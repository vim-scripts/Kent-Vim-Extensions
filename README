The purpose of these extensions is to make the use of Vim easier, especially for programming tasks, while preserving the extraordinary features of Vim, which make
it (imho) one of the best editors available.

The main part, and probably of most interest for you, is the possibility to enter folds. Entering a fold means to hide everything apart from the fold, so that only the fold you have entered is visible. Thus, you will be able to organise your files much better, and to find and edit certain parts of your files much easier and faster. Especially for long source code files, this is very useful.

There are also a lot of other features, please check out the help on that by typing

:help kent

after installation.

Note: These extensions are tested for Vim version 6.1 onwards. No guarantees for lower versions!
